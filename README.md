# Pynitf

## Introduction

This is a python module used to read and write NITF 2.1 files.

The module is extendable, you can add new TREs and can also tie in new objects
to manage TREs. See GeoCal, with the file geocal_nitf_rsm.py to see how this 
works.

Documentation is available at [Pynitf Documentation](https://cartography-jpl.github.io/pynitf/introduction.html).
